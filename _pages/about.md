<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering at UC Chile under the supervision of Professor Pablo Irarrázaval. My work is focused on the intersection between Deep Learning and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. My specific interests are in developing novel data-driven signal processing techniques for Low-Field MRI. I was awarded a full Ph.D. Scholarship from the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID).

Previously, I worked as a full-time lecturer and researcher at Universidad Catolica Boliviana "San Pablo" from 2018 to 2022. My work there focused on Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing applications to Brain-Computer Interfaces (EEG-based Motor Imagery and alternative paradigms as Music Imagery) and Computer Vision (developing several systems for gait recognition in real-time). However, I also contributed to Blockchain, Peace Engineering, Engineering Education, and Serious Games. Some of the courses that I taught were Computer Vision and Electronics Circuits.

In parallel, I'm an active member of the IEEE WG P2731 (Standard for a Unified Terminology for Brain-Computer Interfaces). As an academic, I was honored to review papers for IEEE Access, IEEE EIRCON, and SHIRCON. By 2021, my research team and I received a grant to develop Gait Recognition-based Surveillance Systems using Computer Vision algorithms. Besides, my teams were chosen as Phase 1 winners of the OpenCV AI Competition 2021.
